# Short bio or description (displayed in the header)
description: I am a data analyst who is making use of my ability to look a data from a holistic perspective which allows me to see niche areas where I can have a solid impact on ROI and strategic organizational goals. This, combined with my business partnership experience, allows me to communicate technical concepts in relatable nontechnical ways to increase broader understanding across all business units top-down, bottom-up, and 360.<p>
             
             My goal is to share my skill sets merging what I am doing now with what I have done in the past. <p>
             
             Below you will find samples of projects that I have completed during my course and older projects that I have done on my own to better understand the power and utility of data analytics in a real-world setting.<p>
