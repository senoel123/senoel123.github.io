With Amazon I want to work with a medium sized data set.  There was some cleaning of the data that need to happen before I could better understand what I want to look for.  After a recent experience on Amazon where I bought a stylus based on what I thought where honest reviews I wanted to better understand the frequency of people posting the review.

I also wanted to know what were the most popular words used in posting popular reviews.

It was equally important to know how often did people give five star reviews.

After reading an article in Guardian newspaper I better understood the data I was looking at for Amazon. Companies have gotten smart at gaming the system. A wide spectrum of people are giving there opinion on products but some companies pay people for those positive reviews.

For example you buy a stylus from ANC company.  They send you the stylus along with a solicitation to give a positive review and you recieve a rebate that covers the cost of purchase.  These are not data points that will show up in a dataset nor can you usse machine learning to predict which vendors are engaging in this type of activity.

As a data scientist is important to understand the limitation of what can be done just as much as you are familiar with what can be done.
