**Objectives**

As a data analyst in Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence  (BI)  department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service.  The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries.   My ﬁrst task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system  (RDBMS).   Then, I used SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy.  Here are the main questions they would like to answer: 

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are Rockbuster customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales ﬁgures vary between geographic regions?
