title: Global Layoff Trends 2023
published: true
---

Over the past 3-5 years the global job market has been robust, especially in the US tech sector.  Over the past 3 months, there has been a steady succession of mass
layoffs in the tech sectors from major companies such as Alphabet, Goldman Sachs, and Amazon. My concern is based on if this was a temporary downturn or a major market
correction.

**Objectives**

The storyboard will provide more information about what has been happening in the job market best based on available data. It will use data from the US WARN database and
an international tech sector layoff external data available in Kaggle. Hypothesis: The recent mass layoffs are a market correction in response to increasing inflation.

---
**Key Questions** 

-	On average, how many mass layoffs happen each year?
-	Which states have the most frequency separations?
-	Over the past three years has there been a downward trend in separations?
-	Which industry has the most layoffs?
-	Has all the information in the data set been consented to by the employees affected?
-	Who can access the data? Is it completely public or are there any restrictions on who can access the data?
