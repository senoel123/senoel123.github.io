A large company named XYZ, employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees.  However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market.

**Project**

The management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company, because of the following reasons –

1.	The former employees’ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners
2.	A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purpose of recruiting new talent
3.	More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatize themselves to the company
