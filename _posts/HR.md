This topic has is a topic that I have a high interest in.  I started  looking at the numbers as reported by the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/reports/gender-gap-2020-report-100-years-pay-equality/digest) which stated that Western Europe has made the most progress on gender parity (standing at 76.7%), followed by North America (72.9%), Latin America and the Caribbean (72.2%), Eastern Europe and Central Asia (71.3%), Sub-Saharan Africa (68.2%), South Asia (66.1%) and the Middle East and North Africa (60.5%).  

When I came across a large Human Resources dataset I wanted analyze the number to see if that aligned with what was reported in 2020. As with most datasets I have to to become familiar with dataset.  After running Pandas Profile report I had a starting point to better undersatnd the data.
