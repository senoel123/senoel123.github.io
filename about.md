### Background

I am a native New Yorker who holds an MBA in International business as well as formal training in culinary arts and filmmaking.  Throughout my career I have always relied on my business acumen to forge a path forward whether I am in the US or here in Europe.

The path towards data science encompasses a multiple discipline approach that blends all my experiences in a way that yield a unique insight that can be both creative and pragmatic.

Using analytical skills combined communication with C-suite I have been able to successful build a career in the US and Europe.  Over the past year I have completed my certification to become a Data Scientist with hands on training in end-to-end machine learning process. My goal is to apply a combination of communication, technical knowledge to not only gather data but to analyze data based on the specific needs and goals of an organization to achieve a desired objective.
