**Project**

Instacart already has very good sales but wants to uncover more information about its sales patterns. The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they influence the sale of their products.

**Goals**

First, perform an initial and exploratory analysis of some of their data to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. My analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

**Key Questions**

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*rCqTjjiDklEApUOahxkdbw.jpeg" align="right" width="300" height="300"/>

- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
  - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
  - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age?Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
  - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
