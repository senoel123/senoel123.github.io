My path towards data science encompassed a multiple discipline approach that blended all my business and create experiences in a way that combines meaningful elements as well as building visual frameworks which is integral to my approach. Studying for multiple certifications in data science I relied o nmy MBA in International business as well as formal training in culinary arts and filmmaking to take a different approach.  Throughout my career I have always relied on my business acumen to forge a path forward whether I am in the US or here in Europe.

Making use of the ability to look a data from a holistic perspective allows me to see niche areas that can have a solid impact on ROI and strategic organizational goals.  This, combined with my business partnership experience, allows me to communicate technical concepts in relatable nontechnical ways to increase broader understanding across all business units top-down, bottom-up, and 360. 

Generally, I seek out projects that require a new skill to learn or improve upon. The projects that generate the most enthusiasm are autonomous and collaborative elements that utilize my experience in data analytics, HRIS, full-cycle recruitment, HR management, and client management.
